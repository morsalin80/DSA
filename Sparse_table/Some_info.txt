#Sparse table can be applied if and only if:

1.Arr is immutable (i.e. queries do not change it)(update can not be possible)
2.Function F is associative: F(a, b, c) = F(F(a, b), c) = F(a, F(b, c)).

#it can query mostly in O(logn) but it can find RMQ in O(1).
#It takes o(nlogn) to build and O(1) for RMQ
#column size can be equal to floor(log(n))+1 , where n is the size of the array
#row size can be equal to n,where n is the size of the array
